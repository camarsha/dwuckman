## Optical Model Calculations

This is a side project that hopefully will be fleshed out slowly over the coming months. The idea is to 
have a lightweight optical model code that can be called easily by other programs. Right now it is in the testing 
stage.

## To Do

1) Spin Orbit

2) Validate Cross Sections

3) Spin 1/2 projectiles

4) Analyzing powers and Total Cross Sections
